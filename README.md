Project Description: This project involves creating a graphical representation used to design structured programs, breaking down logic into sequential, conditional, and looping structures. I contributed primarily to building the logic of various structures and parts of the GUI.

Technologies: I worked mainly with C++, using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to simplify and organise the code. By applying OOP principles, I was able to create modular and reusable components, making the program easier to maintain and extend. I focused on optimising the codeâ€™s structure while ensuring the GUI remains intuitive and responsive.
